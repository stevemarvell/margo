# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature establishes a consistent branch naming convention for the project to improve organization, clarity, and team collaboration. The naming scheme should be intuitive, descriptive, and support different types of development work including features, bug fixes, hotfixes, and experimental work.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clear branch naming convention, so that I can quickly understand what type of work is being done in each branch.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a new branch THEN the developer SHALL use a standardized prefix that indicates the type of work
2. WHEN viewing branch lists THEN team members SHALL be able to identify the purpose of each branch from its name
3. WHEN searching for branches THEN developers SHALL be able to filter by work type using the prefix

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want branch names to include descriptive information, so that I can understand the scope and purpose without needing additional context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a branch name THEN it SHALL include a brief description of the work being done
2. WHEN the branch name exceeds reasonable length THEN it SHALL prioritize clarity over brevity
3. WHEN multiple words are needed THEN they SHALL be separated using kebab-case format

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a team member, I want branch names to reference related issues or tickets, so that I can easily trace work back to requirements or bug reports.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a branch relates to a GitHub issue THEN the branch name SHALL include the issue number
2. WHEN a branch relates to external tracking THEN it MAY include the external ticket reference
3. WHEN no issue exists THEN the branch name SHALL be descriptive enough to stand alone

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the naming convention to support different types of development work, so that all common scenarios are covered by the standard.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing new functionality THEN the branch SHALL use the "feature/" prefix
2. WHEN fixing bugs THEN the branch SHALL use the "fix/" or "bugfix/" prefix
3. WHEN making urgent production fixes THEN the branch SHALL use the "hotfix/" prefix
4. WHEN doing experimental work THEN the branch SHALL use the "experiment/" prefix
5. WHEN refactoring code THEN the branch SHALL use the "refactor/" prefix
6. WHEN updating documentation THEN the branch SHALL use the "docs/" prefix
7. WHEN working on CI/CD or tooling THEN the branch SHALL use the "chore/" prefix

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want examples and guidelines for the naming convention, so that I can apply it consistently without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the convention is documented THEN it SHALL include clear examples for each branch type
2. WHEN edge cases arise THEN the documentation SHALL provide guidance for handling them
3. WHEN the convention is updated THEN existing branches MAY remain unchanged but new branches SHALL follow the updated standard
