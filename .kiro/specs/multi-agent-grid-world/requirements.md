# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a multi-agent grid world simulation as a Progressive Web App (PWA) using React and Ionic. The application will be mobile-first with full accessibility support, allowing users to create, configure, and run agent simulations in a grid-based environment. Users can add predefined agents, upload WebAssembly modules, or write Rust code that gets compiled in-app. The system includes example agents in multiple programming languages and provides comprehensive configuration options through an intuitive mobile interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access a mobile-first PWA grid world simulation, so that I can run agent simulations on any device with optimal mobile experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display a responsive grid world interface optimized for mobile devices
2. WHEN accessed on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL provide touch-friendly controls and navigation
3. WHEN installed as a PWA THEN the system SHALL function offline for basic simulation operations
4. WHEN the viewport changes THEN the system SHALL adapt the layout responsively

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want full accessibility support with theme options, so that I can use the application regardless of my visual requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses preferences THEN the system SHALL provide dark mode and high contrast theme options through Ionic palettes
2. WHEN using screen readers THEN the system SHALL provide proper ARIA labels and semantic markup for all interactive elements
3. WHEN navigating with keyboard THEN the system SHALL support full keyboard navigation throughout the application
4. WHEN themes are changed THEN the system SHALL persist the user's accessibility preferences

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to add different types of agents to the grid world, so that I can experiment with various agent behaviors and implementations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding agents THEN the system SHALL provide a selection of predefined agent types with different behaviors
2. WHEN uploading custom agents THEN the system SHALL accept WebAssembly (WASM) modules as agent implementations
3. WHEN writing custom code THEN the system SHALL provide a dialog for entering Rust code that gets compiled to WASM in-app
4. WHEN agents are added THEN the system SHALL validate the agent implementation before allowing placement in the grid

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want access to example agents in different programming languages, so that I can learn from existing implementations and use them as starting points.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN browsing examples THEN the system SHALL provide a directory of example agents in multiple programming languages
2. WHEN selecting an example THEN the system SHALL display the source code and allow compilation/loading into the simulation
3. WHEN compiling examples THEN the system SHALL support in-app compilation for supported languages
4. WHEN examples are loaded THEN the system SHALL provide documentation explaining the agent's behavior and implementation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure the grid world and agents through an intuitive mobile interface, so that I can easily set up and modify simulations on mobile devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the simulation THEN the system SHALL provide configuration options in a split pane layout on larger screens
2. WHEN using mobile devices THEN the system SHALL place configuration options under the grid in a collapsible interface
3. WHEN accessing preferences THEN the system SHALL provide a dedicated preferences menu for app-wide settings
4. WHEN making configuration changes THEN the system SHALL apply changes to the simulation in real-time where appropriate

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to run and control grid world simulations, so that I can observe agent behaviors and interactions in real-time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting a simulation THEN the system SHALL execute agent behaviors according to their programmed logic
2. WHEN controlling simulation THEN the system SHALL provide play, pause, step, and reset controls
3. WHEN agents interact THEN the system SHALL handle collisions, communications, and other agent interactions according to defined rules
4. WHEN simulation runs THEN the system SHALL update the grid display in real-time showing agent positions and states

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want in-app compilation capabilities, so that I can write and test agent code without external tooling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing Rust code THEN the system SHALL provide a code editor with syntax highlighting and basic IDE features
2. WHEN compiling code THEN the system SHALL compile Rust code to WebAssembly within the application
3. WHEN compilation fails THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages and suggestions for fixes
4. WHEN compilation succeeds THEN the system SHALL automatically load the compiled agent into the available agents list
